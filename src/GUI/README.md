This GUI runs in python and uses Flask to run as a local webpage.
To run the webapp, from a command line that is open to the GUI folder containing basic_gui.py, run the command "python basic_gui.py".

This program is intended to be installed on the VCU Athena HPRC server, in the cenr_lab directory. 
If you should have access to this server or group and don't, contact an administrator.

Models should be uploaded as a .zip file of the folder for any pytorch model that has been trained on the expected data format. 
ex. best_model was used to develop and test this interface.
